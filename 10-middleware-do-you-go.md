# Middleware Do You Go?

In the previous [Understand Django](https://www.mattlayman.com/understand-django/) article, we covered the built-in auth system. That article gave you a chance to see the `User` model, ways to login users with Django’s authentication tools, and the features that make the authorization controls work. In that topic, middleware came up as an integral component. Now we’re going to learn more about middleware and its function within a Django project.

## How Should I Think About Middleware?

To start this topic, let’s figure out where middleware exists in a Django project.

Middleware is code that exists in the middle. “In the middle of what?” you might ask. The “middle” is the code that executes between when an `HttpRequest` is created by the framework and when the code you wrote is called by Django. The “middle” can also refer to code that executes _after_ your view completes but before Django translates the `HttpResponse` to bytes to send it over the network to a browser.

Have you ever eaten an Everlasting Gobstopper? No, I don’t mean the one from Willy Wonka that will last forever. An Everlasting Gobstopper is a hard, layered candy that changes colors and flavors as you keep it in your mouth until you finally get to a soft center.

Middleware is kind of like those candy layers and your view code is like the soft center. My analogy breaks down when you think about how someone eats the candy.

With the candy, you experience one layer at a time until you get to the middle and you’re done. A more apt comparison to middleware would be to burrow _through_ the layers and come out the other side, experiencing the same layers in the opposite order as the way you came in.

What’s shown below is a diagram of all the default middleware that is included when you run the `startproject` command. If you’re a visual learner who didn’t find my gobstopper analogy helpful, then I hope this picture will be more illustrative.

               |||||||                               |||||||

               |||||||                               |||||||
```

How does Django make this layering work? When you start Django with an application server like Gunicorn, you have to give the application server the path to your WSGI module. We will cover application servers in a later topic, but, for now, know that an application server can run your Django app. If your project directory containing your settings file is called `project`, then calling Gunicorn looks like:

```shell
gunicorn project.wsgi
```

You’d have this setup if you ran `django-admin startproject project .` (including the last dot), but what’s really needed by the application server is wherever your `wsgi.py` file is located in your project, _in module path form_. Adjust accordingly for your needs.

Remember way back in the first article of the series that WSGI stands for the Web Server Gateway Interface and is the common layer that synchronous Python web apps must implement in order to work with Python application servers. Inside this `project.wsgi` module is a function called `get_wsgi_application`, imported from `django.core.wsgi`.

`get_wsgi_application` does two things:

- Calls `django.setup` which does all the startup configuration that we saw in the last article
- Returns a `WSGIHandler` instance

As you might guess, the `WSGIHandler` is designed to make the WSGI interface work, but it is also a subclass of `django.core.handlers.base.BaseHandler`. This base handler class is where Django handles middleware setup.

The base handler includes a `load_middleware` method. This method has the job of iterating through all the middleware listed in your `MIDDLEWARE` setting. As it iterates through the `MIDDLEWARE`, the method’s primary objective is to include each middleware in the _middleware chain_.

> _The middleware chain is the Django gobstopper._

The chain represents each instance of Django middleware, layered together, to produce the desired effect of allowing a request and response to pass through each middleware.

Aside from building the middleware chain, `load_middleware` must do some other important configuration.

- The method handles synchronous and asynchronous middleware. As Django increases its support of async development, the internals of Django need to manage the differences. `load_middleware` makes some alterations depending on what it can discover about a middleware class.
- The method registers a middleware with certain _sets_ of middleware based on the presence of various hook methods. We’ll discuss those hooks later in this article.

That explains middleware’s structure and how all the middleware interacts with the request and response lifecycle, but what does middleware do?

We can use middleware for a wide variety of purposes. Because of the middleware chain, a successful HTTP request will pass through every middleware. This property of middleware makes it ideal for code that we want to execute globally for our Django project.

For instance, think back to our last article on [User Authentication](https://www.mattlayman.com/understand-django/user-authentication/). In that article, we observed that Django’s auth system is dependent on the `AuthenticationMiddleware`. This middleware has the singular job of adding a `user` property to every `HttpRequest` object that passes through the application before the request gets to view code.

The `AuthenticationMiddleware` highlights some qualities that are good for middleware in Django.

- A middleware should ideally have a narrow or singular objective.
- A middleware should run a minimal amount of code.

_Why?_ Again, the answer is related to the middleware chain. Since the HTTP request will pass through every middleware in the chain, then we can see that _every middleware will execute for every request._ In other words, each middleware carries a performance overhead for each request.

There **is** an exception to this behavior of the chain. A middleware early in the chain can prevent middleware later in the chain from running.

For example, the `SecurityMiddleware` is first in the default middleware chain from a `startproject` generated project. This middleware is designed to do some checks to keep the application secure. One check is to look for a secure connection (i.e., a request using HTTPS) if HTTPS is configured. If a request comes to the application and uses HTTP instead of HTTPS, the middleware can return an `HttpResponsePermanentRedirect` that redirects to the same URL with `https://` and prevents the rest of the chain from running.

Aside from this exceptional behavior in middleware, it’s important to remember that, in most circumstances, each middleware will run for each request. We should be aware of that performance aspect when creating our own middleware.

Now we’re ready to learn about how we can create our own middleware!

## How Can I Write My Own Custom Middleware?

Let’s assume that you’ve found a good case to create a middleware. You need something that happens with every request and that functionality has a narrow goal.

You can begin with an empty middleware definition. In my example, we’re going to put the middleware in a `middleware.py` file.

```python
# project/middleware.py
class AwesomeMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response

    def __call__(self, request):
        return self.get_response(
            request
        )
```

After creating the middleware, you add it to your settings.

```python
# project/settings.py

MIDDLEWARE = [
    'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
    ...,
    'middleware.AwesomeMiddleware',
]
```

_That’s it!_ This custom middleware doesn’t do anything except slow performance slightly because it’s an extra method call on every request. Since I put the middleware at the end of the `MIDDLEWARE` list, it will be the last middleware to run before a view receives a request and the first middleware with the chance to process a response.

We can break down how this class works.

- The `__init__` method gets a callable that is conventionally named `get_response`. The middleware is created during `load_middleware` and the callable is a key part of what makes the middleware chain work. The callable will either call the next middleware or the view depending on where the current middleware is in the chain.
- The `__call__` method transforms the middleware instance itself into a callable. The method must call `get_response` to ensure that the chain is unbroken.

If you want to do extra work, you can make changes to the `__call__` method. You can modify `__call__` to process changes before or after the call of `get_response`. In the request/response lifecycle, changes before `get_response` occur before the view is called while changes after `get_response` can handle the `response` itself or any other post-request processing.

Let’s say we want our example middleware to record some timing information. We might update the code to look like:

```python
# project/middleware.py
import logging
import time

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


class AwesomeMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response

    def __call__(self, request):
        before_timestamp = time.time()
        logger.info(
            f"Tracking {before_timestamp}"
        )

        response = self.get_response(request)

        after_timestamp = time.time()
        delta = after_timestamp - before_timestamp
        logger.info(
            f"Tracking {after_timestamp} for a delta of {delta}"
        )

        return response
```

We still haven’t covered logging yet, but you can understand it as recording messages to some output source like a file.

This example acts as a crude performance monitor. If you wanted to measure the response time of a view, this middleware would do that. The downside is that it wouldn’t tell you _which_ view is recorded. Hey, give me a break, this is a silly example! 🤪

Hopefully, you’re beginning to see how middleware can be useful. But wait! There’s more that middleware can do.

A Django middleware can define any of three different hook methods that Django will run at different parts of the request/response lifecycle. The three methods are:

- `process_exception` - This hook is called whenever a view raises an exception. This could include an uncaught exception from the view, but the hook will also receive exceptions that are intentionally raised like `Http404`.
- `process_template_response` - This hook is called whenever a view returns a response that looks like a template response (i.e., the response object has a `render` method).
- `process_view` - This hook is called right before the view.

Returning to our silly example, we can make it less silly by using the `process_view` hook. Let’s see what we can do:

```python
# project/middleware.py
import logging
import time

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


class AwesomeMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, get_response):
        self.get_response = get_response

    def __call__(self, request):
        before_timestamp = time.time()
        logger.info(
            f"Tracking {before_timestamp}"
        )

        response = self.get_response(request)

        after_timestamp = time.time()
        delta = after_timestamp - before_timestamp
        logger.info(
            f"Tracking {after_timestamp} for a delta of {delta}"
        )

        return response

    def process_view(self, request, view_func, view_args, view_kwargs):
        logger.info(
            f"Running {view_func.__name__} view"
        )
```

Now our middleware uses Python’s reflection capabilities to record the view’s name. If accessing the Django admin with an unauthenticated user, the log might record something like:

```text
Tracking 1607438038.232886
Running login view
Tracking 1607438038.261855 for a delta of 0.02896881103515625
```

This middleware could still benefit from a lot of polish, but you can see how the hooks make it possible for a middleware to have more advanced functionality.

As an example of the `process_exception` middleware, consider a service that collects and reports exceptions to track the health of your application. There are many of these services like [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/) and [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/). I happen to be a Rollbar user so I’ll comment on that one. You can see from the [pyrollbar code](https://github.com/rollbar/pyrollbar/blob/8d116a374f2c54da886972f7da7c289e317bbd8a/rollbar/contrib/django/middleware.py#L268) that the service sends exception information from the `process_exception` hook to Rollbar via their `rollbar.report_exc_info` function. Without middleware, capturing and reporting exceptions would be _significantly_ harder.

Want to learn more about hooks? You can see all the details about these hooks in the [middleware documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/http/middleware/#other-middleware-hooks).

## What Middleware Does Django Include?

We’ve looked at the mental model for middleware and all the details of how an individual middleware works. What middleware does Django include in the framework?

The full list of built-in middleware is available in the [middleware reference](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/middleware/). I’ll describe what I think are the most common or useful middleware classes that Django includes.

- `AuthenticationMiddleware` - We’ve already encountered this middleware in the exploration of the auth system. The job of this middleware is to add the `user` attribute to an `HttpRequest` object. That one little `user` attribute powers many of the features of the auth system.
- `CommonMiddleware` - The common middleware is a bit of an oddball. This middleware handles a variety of Django settings to control certain aspects of your project. For instance, the `APPEND_SLASH` setting will redirect a request like `example.com/accounts` to `example.com/accounts/`. This setting only works if the `CommonMiddleware` is included.
- `CsrfViewMiddleware` - In the forms article, I mentioned the CSRF token. As a reminder, this is a security feature that helps protect your project against malicious sources that want to send bad data to your site. The `CsrfViewMiddleware` ensures that the CSRF token is present and valid on form submissions.
- `LocaleMiddleware` - This middleware is for handling translations if you choose to internationalize your project.
- `MessageMiddleware` - The message middleware is for “flash messages.” These are one-time messages that you’d likely see after submitting a form, though they can be used in many places. We’ll discuss messages more when we get to the sessions topic.
- `SecurityMiddleware` - The security middleware includes a number of checks to help keep your site secure. We saw the example of checking for HTTPS earlier in this article. This middleware also handles things like XSS, HSTS, and a bunch of other acronyms (😛) that will be seen with the future security topic.
- `SessionMiddleware` - The session middleware manages session state for a user. Sessions are crucial for many parts of Django like user auth.

As you can see from this incomplete list, Django’s middleware can do a lot to enrich your project in a wide variety of ways. Middleware is an extremely powerful concept for Django projects and a great tool to extend your application’s request handling.

Remember, middleware comes with a performance cost so avoid the temptation to stuff too much functionality into the middleware chain. As long as you’re aware of the tradeoffs, middleware is a great tool for your toolbelt.
